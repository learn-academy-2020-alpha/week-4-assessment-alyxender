# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.  

1. What is an instance variable in Ruby? How is it different from other variables?

  Your answer:
  An instance variable uses an @ symbol in the begining and is local to the scope of the current class you are working in.
  Researched answer:
  "In the Ruby programming language, an instance variable is a type of variable which starts with an @ symbol."
  "An instance variable is used as part of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to give objects their own private space to store data."


2. What is a block in Ruby?

  Your answer:
  A section containing the logic or data of the individual method. 

  Researched answer:
  "A Ruby block is a way of grouping statements, and may appear only in the source adjacent to a method call"



3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer:
  ... a bit fuzzy on this but I feel its the fact we dont have to specifically use return{} in our methods and it will use default values/arguments. Will research more! 

  Researched answer:
  "Any statement in Ruby returns the value of the last evaluated expression. A simple example is the getter method. We call a method and expect some value in return. But as we know, Ruby always returns the last evaluated expression"



4. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer:
  OOP is a methodology/paradigm in programming. (its a state of mind maaaaan)
  OOP is different from functional programming in the sense that we do not use variables and functions nor do we build our methods out by themselves. Rather we use objects that will contain not only the methods and values but other data as well. 

  Researched answer:
  The basic elements of functional programming are Variables and Functions. The basic elements of object-oriented programming are objects and methods. The functional programming is used only when there are few things with more operations. Object-oriented programming is used when there are many things with few operations.

5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer:
  An object is simply an entity/instance, without a class it has no meaning. (and it will never find love)
  A class is the blueprint of an object. It gives the object its structure and logic. (and might still never find love. its code. it has no emotions. cmon now. unless you program that into it. then we're talking about something completely different and.. I digress.)

  Researched answer:
  " A class is a blueprint from which objects are created. The object is also called as an instance of a class. For Example, the animal is a class and mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians are the instances of the class."
  (..still firm on that no love thing.)
